# PreMiD

[![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/premid/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/premid)

PreMiD is a simple, configurable utility that lets you show what you're doing on the web in your Discord profile. Whether you're watching videos, listening to music, browsing your favorite sites, or playing browser games, PreMiD helps you share your online activities with your friends through Discord's Rich Presence feature.

## Getting Started

**Looking to use PreMiD?** Head over to our [official website](https://premid.app) to add the browser extension!

**Want to create your own Activity?** All of our community-created activities are open source and available at [github.com/PreMiD/Activities](https://github.com/PreMiD/Activities). We'd love to see what you create!

## Features

- 🎵 Show what you're listening to on YouTube and more (Spotify has native Discord support)
- 📺 Display what you're watching on Netflix, Disney+, Twitch, and hundreds of other sites
- 🎮 Share your browser game activity with friends
- ✨ Fully customizable with thousands of user-created Activities
- 🌍 Available in multiple languages thanks to our amazing community translators

## Contributing

We love community contributions! While **PreMiD's Activities are fully open source** (the code that makes websites show up on your profile), the PreMiD extension is not currently open source. This decision allows our small team to move fast and iterate quickly to deliver the best experience possible.
